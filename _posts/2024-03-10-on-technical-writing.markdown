1. **Story**
	- Introduction of our hero/es, obstacle is encountered, finally it's overcome.
2. **Structure**
	- Tell them what you're going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you just told them.
	- Sections with headings.
3. **Consistency**
	- Refer to the same concepts always with the same words.
	- If you use images or diagrams, colours and shapes should always refer to the same types of things.
4. **Examples**
	- It helps people understand your abstract concepts and also makes your writing less dry.
5. **Conciseness**
	- Write your first draft without thinking about conciseness. Reduce your draft to half the size. Then reduce it to half that size. Then try and reduce that a bit more.
6. **Audience**
	- Who is this text for? Adapt accordingly:
		- Is the style appropriate?
		- Are you using too much/unnecessary technical jargon?
7. **Respite**
	- Offer breathing room between blocks of text. 
		- Images
		- Changes in length of paragraphs
		- Callouts
		- Jokes
8. **Format**
	- Interline space, about 1.5.
	- Use **boldface**, *italics* and other resources (sparingly) to highlight interesting sections. Allow folks to read diagonally (they will anyway, why not guide their eyes).
	- Use bullet points and numerated lists.
9. **Style**
	- Use connectors:
		- First...
		- What's more...
		- In conclusion...
	- Don't be afraid to be casual (but see point 6).
		- "In other words, it's crap".
		- "Hey system, do this".
		- "The computer happily chugs along".
10. **Grammar, spelling**
11. **Hammer the point home**
	- Tell them what you're going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you just told them.
	- Each sentence should lead to your thesis.
	- Ask yourself: "What is this paragraph building up to? And this sentence? If they don't prop up my thesis, why did I write them?".
